# Greetings Portal 👋

Currently working on enhancing and optimizing the Web3 DApp that I created during Buildspace's 'Intro to Web3' Cohort.

1. Smart Contract for this DApp: https://github.com/subhojyotisaha/greeting-portal-smart-contract
2. Current state of the DApp: https://greetings-portal.netlify.app/
3. Rinkeby Test Network Contract Address: https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x6c56632049Ed778A7F379682ea933800D86503Bc

### **TO-DO**

1. Make site responsive and usable for phones. (Use tailwind css)
2. Optimize Contract and add other features
3. Detect and Update for Wallet Change without refreshing.
